# Threadline: Code Quality That Actually Works

## The Problem

Getting teams to follow consistent quality standards is **hard**. Really hard.

You've tried everything:

- 📚 **Documentation** → Nobody reads it. Or it's outdated before you finish writing it.
- 🔍 **Linting** → Catches syntax errors, but misses the nuanced stuff that actually matters.
- 🤖 **AI Code Reviewers** → Powerful, but you can't trust them. Did they actually check what you care about? Can you customize them with your team's specific rules?

The result? Inconsistent code quality, technical debt that creeps in, and endless back-and-forth in PR reviews about things that should have been caught earlier.

## The Solution

**Threadline** guides you to structure **active documentation** right inside your repository, alongside your code. Then we run massively parallel AI-powered code checks—each focused on a single, specific concern—with full auditability so you can trust the results.

### What Makes Threadline Different?

🎯 **Focused Experts**  
Instead of one AI trying to check everything, Threadline runs multiple specialized AI reviewers in parallel. Each expert focuses on one thing and does it well.

📝 **Documentation That Lives With Your Code**  
Your coding standards live in your repo, in a `/threadlines` folder. They're version-controlled, reviewable, and always in sync with your codebase.

🔍 **Fully Auditable**  
Every AI review decision is logged and traceable. You can see exactly what was checked, why it passed or failed, and have confidence in the results.

⚡ **Fast & Parallel**  
Multiple experts run simultaneously, so you get comprehensive feedback in seconds, not minutes.

## The Promise

Threadline doesn't replace your team's judgment. It amplifies it. By codifying your standards and running focused, auditable checks, you get:

- **Consistency** across your entire codebase
- **Confidence** that important rules are actually being followed
- **Speed** in code checks, with fewer back-and-forth cycles
- **Control** over what gets checked and how
